So what does that P1.ID < P2.ID clause do in the last example query?
This double checks that the IDs are different making sure that they are not duplicates.

The query that joined the Player table to itself seems rather contrived. Can you think of a realistic situation in which youâ€™d want to join a table to itself?
Whenever a table contains references to data in itself like if an employee table contained a supervisorid column pointing to an employee that is the supervisor of the current employee.
