1. Answer the following questions with respect to the baseline web service your team built in the lab.

a. Is the service RESTful? If not, why not? If so, what key features make it RESTful.

Yes, the service is RESTful because it uses the HTTP methods explicitly, it is stateless, has an exposed directory structure-like URI, and uses XML or JSON data.

b. What endpoints implement actions that are idempotent? nullipotent?

All GET, DELETE, and PUT operations are idempotent. All GET operations are also nullipotent and all POST operations are neither idempotent or nullipotent.

c. What evidence, if any, do you see of the commonly-cited impedance mismatch problem in object-relational information systems?

We encountered impedance mismatch problems while implementing the GET functionality of our application. DAO constructors have to be ordered to match the database schema.

d. Would the web service built in the lab be susceptible to SQL-injection attacks?

Assuming that the template given to us followed the appropriate security guidelines then the web service would not be susceptible to SQL-injection attacks.
