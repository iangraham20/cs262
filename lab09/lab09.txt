Exercise 9.1

Study the lab starter code and answer the following questions.

    a. How many API endpoints does this application support and where are they implemented?

        This application supports two API endpoints, which are implemented at the following locations:

        https://calvincs262-monopoly.appspot.com/monopoly/v1/players
        https://calvincs262-monopoly.appspot.com/monopoly/v1/player/ insert ID #


    b. PlayerResource.java
        i. What is the Java-based technology used to access data from a database?

            The Java-based technology used to access the data is a JDBC or Java Database Connectivity, which is an API for Java languages that allows clients to access the database in specific ways.



        Compare and contrast the following:
            1. SQL query statements vs. JDBC statement objects

                JDBC statement objects serve as an interface for the SQL query statements by taking in arguments and passing a reformatted version to the database.



            2. SQL relations vs. JDBC result sets vs. List<Player>

                SQL relations are sets of tuples containing elements that are linked to a data domain.

                JDBC result sets are Java objects that contain result of executing SQL queries.

                List<Player> is a list of player objects that are obtained through parsing the ResultSet object and adding the elements to the ResultSet as new elements of List<Player>.



        iii. Under what circumstances would the function getValueStringOrNull() be used?

            The getValueStringOrNull() method would be called if a player's ID value is NULL.


    C. Player.java
        i. What purpose does this Player DAO serve?

            The DAO or Data Access Object creates an object-oriented version of the SQL relational database.



        ii. How does it compare with the Player table?

            It is exactly the same except that it is constructed through a Class structure instead of a database table.
